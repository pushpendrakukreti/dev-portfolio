            Hey There, I am <span className="purple">Pushpendra Kukreti </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Delhi, India.</span>
            <br /> <br />
            I am a software engineer specializing in building and designing
            exceptional digital experiences. I am passionate about creativity
            and innovation in the digital landscape.
            <br /> <br />
            My interest in web development began in 2017 when I created a
            prototype for a Fitness web app as part of my college
            project. This experience taught me a great deal about ReactJs, HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, Semantic & Material UI.
            <br /> <br />I feel privileged to work with Capgemini, one of the
            top technology companies in the world. Additionally, I have
            contributed to Koenigâ€™s in-house project, which is an IT training
            company with multiple centers worldwide, and I have gained valuable
            experience at RSS Infotech, a tech startup. Currently, my primary
            focus is to dive deeper into blockchain technology.
            <br /> <br /> Apart from coding, some other activities that I love
            to do!
